// Challenges faced when writing DNA program
// 1. I couldn't figure out how to swap all the letters for the complement
// I realized if I used placeholders in lowercase then when I converted
// the other letters the originals wouldn't be changed. Then afterwards
// I changed the placeholders into the proper conversions.
// 2. I couldn't figure out how to add an extra character into a string so
// I googled it and I learned more about substrings. After that it was
// easy to do all of the remaining conversions.
